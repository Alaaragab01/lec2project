    <h2>Cat lovers</h2>
    <p class="fprag">Pet owners have been pigeonholed for almost as long as cats and 
        dogs have been domesticated. Cat owners are typically seen as having aloof, cautious
        and independent personalities. Dog owners, on the other hand, are seen to be playful, 
        outgoing and loyal. But should we really pay attention to these stereotypes?</p>
    </div class="second">
    <h3>Does your choice of pet affect your personality?</h3>
    <p class="sprag">It might seem unlikely, but it turns out there really might be a link between personality and pet preference.
         Researchers from the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233630429_Personalities_of_Self-Identified_Dog_People_and_Cat_People" target="_blank" title="Personalities_of_Self-Identified_Dog_People_and_Cat_People">University of Texas</a> examined five main character traits —  extraversion, agreeableness, 
         conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness — to see whether there were any differences 
         between people who identified as cat people or <a href="index2.html" target="_blank" title="dog photos">dog people</a> .
        They found that most respondents who identified themselves as introverted and sensitive were cat lovers, 
        while those who said they were extroverted and agreeable were more typically dog people.</p>
